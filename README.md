# freecodecamp Voting App

This repo contains source code for full Stack freecodecamp software engineering curriculum project of a voting app. 

This appp is hosted on `heroku` and is worked around the concept of authentication using `passport`

Requires user to log in using their twitter account inorder to view polls and create new poll to upvote them

`!isAuthenticated()` user and `isAuthenticated()` user can still view polls and upvote them them but to create new poll, a user need to be logged in to their account. 

The result of the vote is visualized using  a data visualization library in this case i'm going to user `chartjs` for this project.

## Let's code!
